These are my personal solutions to problems on Project Euler.
The math solutions themselves are written in Python and are in the 'backend' directory 
and were developed with Pycharm, but open and execute in a VS Code terminal.
Usage: Update Driver to specify which problem you wish to solve, call Driver via command line.

There is a Vue frontend with a (temporary) json db that holds problem information
such as problem information, input parameters and solutions. This was developed in VS Code.

This will be expanded over time to hold solution performance information, ability to switch 
between solution api's, allowing direct comparison between solutions in python vs C# vs F# etc.

Note: Python backend is not currently connected to UI (yet).
Usage: Open in VS Code, open terminal in main directory, exec npm install @vue/cli, npm install
